            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And hence (I firſt infer,) That whatever Fault was or is found in Man's Will, it cannot be laid at God's Door. Was it from Want of Power, was it not from the abuſe of the Freedom of his VVill, that Man fell?

                  <p>Laſt <hi>Inference</hi> is, They who would give (and have) an Evidence, that their Trading is into (and in) Heaven, ſhould make much uſe of Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15, 16. Deut. 18.15. 2 Cor. 8.5.</note> and of every one of his Offices. Should they not daily employ this Prieſt, learn of this Prophet, and ſubmit to this King?</p>
                  <p>A touch on every one of theſe is to follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The 21ſt Poſition. <hi>That there might be Communion between God and fallen Man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Mediator in the caſe, engaged in the Office of a Prieſt.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="2">2. Is he not in Scripture-Hiſtory written of as ſuch? Yea,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hath he not the Title of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the higheſt Church-Officer under the New Teſtament; and of the High-Prieſt, to whom ſome Employs were peculiar under the Law?</p>
                  <p>That this Prieſt procureth (yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteth) Communion between God and Man, cannot well be queſtioned.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is it not rightly ſaid, That the Heart of Chriſt's Mediation lieth in his Prieſtly Office and the Exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?

                  <p>For, 2. Doth he not as a Prieſt deal with God for Man,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.1.</note> that he may as a Prophet and King deal with Man from God?</p>
                  <p>That this may be more evidenced, we will look at the Reſemblance that lies between Chriſt and the High-Prieſt,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.6.5.1.</note> that was Aaronical, and glance at the higher Prieſthood of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">7.26.</note> of whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he was, by whom he was much ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified.</p>
                  <p>As to the former: Was he not, (1.) Taken from among Men? (2.)
<note place="margin">1.9.9.12.</note> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed? (3.) Called to his Office? (4.) Anointed? (5.) Richly arrayed? (6.) Bearing the Names of the People on his Breaſt? (7.) Entering into the Holy of Holies? Surely he who hath all theſe Qualifications, is qualified to deal betwixt his Father and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
                  <p>As to the latter; The Compariſon is carried further than I deſign. Who hint,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramum de Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis.</note> (1.) That <hi>Melchizedec</hi>'s Prieſthood did not paſs from one to another: And is not that of Chriſt unchangeable?

                  <p>And now I infer, 1. That they are forſakers of their own Mercy, in being Slighters of the Heavenly Trade, who make not good uſe of Chriſt's Prieſtly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152543:50"/>Office; into which Count (alas!) great numbers fall. Is not this their caſe?</p>

                  <p>Concerning the Interceſſion of Chriſt, be it remarked:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1. Joh. 14.16.</note> The Act of Interceſſion (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Greek word tranſlated <hi>Advocate,</hi> or <hi>Paraclete)</hi> is applied both to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152543:53"/>the ſecond and third Perſon in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, whereon the Gloſſes of the Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned deſerve weighing.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Interceſſion is aſcribed to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

                  <p n="2">(2.) The Spirit makes Interceſſion in us, Chriſt intercedeth for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> The holy Spirit helpeth our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,

                  <p>So that, as a learned Man notes, being an Advocate is attributed to the holy Spirit in a figurative Senſe; but to be our proper Advocate interceding with the Father on our behalf,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramus.</note> is peculiar to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Again; The Advocateſhip and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt is founded on his having been a Propitiation,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1, 2.</note> or Satisfactory Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer.</p>
                  <p>One to whom I even now referred, writes of and for Chriſt's offering himſelf as a Sacrifice for our Sins in the Celeſtial Sanctuary, into which he is entred; but, he withal owneth, that what he calleth an Oblation, doth not really differ from what we (with Scripture) call Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or his preſenting himſelf as one that was ſlain, and his Blood and Offering as meritorious before his Father.</p>
                  <p>I rejoice, that the worthy Perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his diſlike of the Followers of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152543:53"/>
                     <hi>Socinus,</hi> who yet expreſs their Minds in ſome of his words: He holdeth (what they deny) that the Lord Jeſus ſuffer'd in our ſtead,
<note place="margin">Noſtro lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</note> and doth commend and render acceptable, as our Perſons, ſo our Performances.</p>
                  <p>There is a Scripture which the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians pervert, to wit that that ſaith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 8.4.</note> 
                     <hi>If Chriſt was on Earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt;</hi> arguing from hence againſt the Current of other Scriptures, that in his Death he offer'd not a Satisfactory Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. May not the words <hi>on the Earth,</hi>

And if the Sanctified have learn'd that firſt Principle about knowing the Lord, doth it follow that they need not that any Man ſhould (under him) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach them?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Uſe is for Information.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Branch is, There is a great Difference between ſpiritual Perſons and others. Are not the former the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the Earth,

                  <p>Surely,

                  <p>The third Uſe is for Reproof. 1. This falls fully on thoſe who make the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152543:59"/>of the Spirit matter of Scorn and Drollery,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.3.</note> and brand thoſe as Fanaticks and Franticks that wait for them.</p>

<note place="margin">Jam. 1.21. Rev. 2.7.</note> who being Hearers are only ſo. They hear the Voice of the Servants of God; but to hear what the Spirit ſaith by them, they are not ſollicitous.</p>
                  <p>May it be well weighed, 1. The holy Spirit is the Comforter,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.7.</note> and can they who ſlight him expect Comfort from him, or receive it from a lower Hand?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit is the Spirit of Glory.

                  <p>The fourth Uſe is of Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Branch bendeth towards thoſe that are willingly Strangers to the holy Spirit, and his Teachings. Go they directly (and in a Scripture-Path) to Chriſt for Supply?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Feeling, that naturally they want ſpiritual Sight.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Grieving,

                  <p>The ſecond Branch beareth what is cordial,

                  <p n="1">1. Shall not they be taught the moſt needful and uſeful Points?</p>

                  <p>The laſt <hi>Inference.</hi> All truly good Perſons ſhould learn the proper Leſſons that Chriſt's Humiliation teacheth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is;
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> God the Father ſtood much on the Honour of his Government, and ſo of his Juſtice: To what Pains was Chriſt put?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A fair open way was made for Chriſt's Exaltation.

<note place="margin">Gal. 5.14.</note> and calling others to carry it after him, is not to be ſtumbled at.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.9.</note> A wide Door of Hope is ſet and ſtands open to and for humble Penitents. Did not his drinking of the bitter Cup tend to ſweeten it to them,

                     </note> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their drinking the Dregs of it?</p>

                     <hi>The 29th Poſition. <hi>Chriſt's State of Exaltation maketh much for furthering Communion between God and fallen Man.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doth not God the Father, who hath received the Son, as in our Nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, look on that Nature, and on our Perſons through it,
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.6.</note> if we ſtand in a State of Union to him that took it on him,
<note place="margin">In Capite.</note> as pleaſing to him? yea, doth he not conſider us as in a ſort exalted in (and with) him our Head?
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.6.</note> And are not his Employs and Actings on our behalf pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly regarded by him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we are making Addreſſes to the moſt High,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> is it not our Duty, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Way much to look unto Jeſus, and that as exalted, and appearing in our Nature for us? Doth not this much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us,
<note place="margin">Joh. 20.17.</note> that he is gone to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and our Father, to his God and our God?</p>
                  <p>The Uſe follows, which is, 1. By way of Caution. Tho in managing the ſpiritual Trade, we are with (and by) our Faith to follow Chriſt into Heaven; yet are we much to lie at his Croſs, and conſider him as enduring it, and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Demands of his injured Father.
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2, 3. Rom. 4. <hi>ult.</hi>

                  <p>And ſo I next infer, That all thoſe who are for trading into Heaven, ſhould get and keep diſtinct and clear Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Chriſt as received into Heaven.

                  <p>Are not the Degrees of his Exaltation well worthy of our beſt Thoughts? Do they not exactly anſwer the Degrees that were in his Humiliation?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did not he who died,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15.</note> after Death riſe again?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.9, 10.</note> Did not he who deſcended into the Earth, aſcend into Heaven?</p>

                  <p>Again; Is not Myſtery written on, and to be read in the Ends of Chriſt's Exaltation?</p>
                  <p>And that firſt, 1. In reference to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9, 10. Pſal. 110. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> Is not he rewarded after all his fore Services and Sufferings? Is not his Head lifted up that drunk of the Brook in the way? Hath not his Croſs proved the way to his Crown? And tho he was only capable of being exalted in his Manhood by way of Addition, yet may he that is God be ſaid to be exalted by way of Manifeſtation.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:152543:65"/>2. With reference to us; Is he not full of Compaſſion when freed from Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Doth he not ſympathize, tho he cannot ſuffer?
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15, 16.</note> Is he not entred Heaven with an Heart full of Love to Sinners on Earth? Doth not his tranſacting there make much for our Advantage that are here?</p>
                  <p>The next Inference is, They do not drive the ſpiritual Trade, who neither have nor deſire to have Communion with Chriſt as exalted.
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.6. <hi>See the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Scotch</hi> Brown.</note> Is not he as the Truth, and the Life, ſo the Way? the way to the Father in Duty, and the way from the Father in the Expreſſion of Mercy?

                  <p>And ſo the latter <hi>Inference</hi> is. There are not a few that bear themſelves high on their birth (I mean their natural birth) that have very ſmall reaſon for it. Are they that are meerly born of blood, or as it is read of bloods,

                  <p>One is. They who want the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating work of the holy Spirit ſhould by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152543:77"/>no means (or with no willingneſs) want breathings after it: O that many did pray and cry,
